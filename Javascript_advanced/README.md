# JavaScript Advanced

A collection of JavaScript exercises covering advanced concepts including closures, classes, asynchronous programming, and API interactions.

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains progressive exercises designed to master advanced JavaScript concepts. Each file demonstrates different aspects of modern JavaScript programming, from nested functions and closures to asynchronous operations and DOM manipulation.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **Closures and Scope**: Understanding lexical scoping and closure behavior
- **Functions**: Arrow functions, higher-order functions, and function binding
- **Classes**: ES6 classes with private methods and encapsulation
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Timeouts, promises, and AJAX requests
- **DOM Manipulation**: Creating and manipulating DOM elements
- **API Integration**: Working with external APIs using XMLHttpRequest

## 📝 Notes

- All exercises use **vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks or libraries)
- Code follows modern ES6+ syntax

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **XMLHttpRequest** (for API calls)
- **DOM API** (for browser interactions)
