## HTML Form Project

This project is part of the Holberton School front‑end curriculum and is focused on **creating accessible, well‑structured HTML forms** and understanding how data is collected and sent from the browser.

### Learning objectives

- **Understand the purpose of HTML forms**
  - What a `<form>` element is and when to use it
  - How form submission works (GET vs POST at a high level)
- **Build accessible form structures**
  - Proper use of `<label>` and `for` attributes
  - Grouping related fields with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`
  - Using `name`, `id`, and `value` correctly
- **Use common form controls**
  - Text inputs, passwords, emails, numbers, and textareas
  - Radio buttons and checkboxes
  - Select menus (`<select>` / `<option>`)
  - Buttons (`<button>`, `type="submit"`, `type="reset"`)
- **Apply basic validation**
  - Required fields (`required`)
  - Attribute‑based validation (`min`, `max`, `maxlength`, `pattern`, `type="email"` etc.)
  - Understanding browser validation messages

### What you should be able to do after this project

- Design and implement a complete form for a simple application (e.g. sign‑up, login, contact form).
- Make forms **readable, usable, and accessible**, with clear labels and helpful placeholder/helper text.
- Decide which input types and attributes to use to improve **UX and data quality**.
- Debug common form issues (fields not submitting, wrong `name` attributes, missing labels, etc.).

### Project structure

This directory should contain:

- **HTML files** that define one or more forms
- **CSS files** (if provided) to style the forms and improve usability
- Any **assets** needed for the form examples (images, icons, etc.)

### Requirements

- Use only **semantic HTML** and standard form controls (no JavaScript is required unless specified by the task).
- Ensure that **every input has an associated label** or an accessible name.
- Validate input using **HTML attributes first** before relying on any scripting.

### Resources

You may find these topics useful to review:

- HTML `<form>` element and attributes (`action`, `method`, `autocomplete`, `novalidate`, etc.)
- Input types: `text`, `email`, `password`, `number`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `date`, etc.
- Basic accessibility practices for forms (labels, focus order, error messages).
