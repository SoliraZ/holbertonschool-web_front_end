## Flexbox Project

This project is part of the Holberton School front‑end curriculum and is focused on **understanding what Flexbox is and how it works in CSS**.

### Purpose

- **Learn the Flexbox model**: main axis vs cross axis, flex containers vs flex items.
- **Practice core Flexbox properties** such as:
  - `display: flex`
  - `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`
  - `flex-wrap`, `align-content`
  - `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`
- **Use Flexbox to build real layouts** like navigation bars, multi‑column sections, and responsive card layouts.

### What you should get from this project

- Be able to **identify when Flexbox is a good fit** for a layout problem.
- Be comfortable **creating and debugging flex containers and flex items**.
- Understand how Flexbox helps make layouts **more flexible and responsive** with less code than traditional float‑based techniques.
